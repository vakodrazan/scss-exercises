# Exercise 7: Extending Bootstrap

Let's extend Bootstrap by adding our own series of custom panels, but let's try build these panels the Bootstrap way.

There's a really good article on the Bootstrap website about [how to create your own components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/extend/approach/).

Our panels should:

- behave similar to the Jumbotron
- have the default amount of padding
- support all the Bootstrap background colours
- must adopt an inverse font-color if the background is too dark

Create your panels SCSS file in a new `components` folder in your `scss` folder.

Create a demonstration or testing page called `panels.html` and place it in the root of your project. This HTML page should have examples of the many types of panels, with the various background colours applied.

Good luck!
